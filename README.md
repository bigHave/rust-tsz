# rust-tsz
This is a learning project trying to practice Rust by implementing time series data compression.

Implements the Gorilla compression algorithm based on:
- [go-tsz](https://github.com/dgryski/go-tsz) - Go implementation
- [prometheus-xor](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus) - XOR compression in Prometheus

Feel free to open pr and have fun!
